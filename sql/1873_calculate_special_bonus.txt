Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and 
salary.
 

Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of 
an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd 
number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The 
bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.


My Result:

SELECT employee_id,
       (CASE 
            WHEN employee_id % 2 = 0 THEN 0
            WHEN UPPER(name) LIKE 'M%' THEN 0
            ELSE salary
        END) AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id

Others Result:

SELECT 
   employee_id,
   IF (employee_id % 2 AND SUBSTR(name, 1, 1) <> "M", salary, 0) AS bonus 
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id
